This code attempts to analyze the factors that lead to the readmittance of patients after diabetic incidents using data collected from 130 hospitals between 1999 and 2008, (Link :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). By finding factors or trends that may cause a patient to need to return quickly for further care, it may be possible to identify areas of treatment to be improved, or isolate warning signs and give additional preventative care to an at-risk patient. While the medical community has not yet found a comprehensive cure for diabetes, there are many methods of treatment, medicine, and lifestyle that are helpful towards minimizing the effects of the disease in everyday life and reducing harm should a serious incident occur.
