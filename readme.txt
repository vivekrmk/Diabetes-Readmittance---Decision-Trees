This code attempts to analyze the factors that lead to the readmittance of patients after diabetic incidents using data collected from 130 hospitals between 1999 and 2008, (Link :https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008). By finding factors or trends that may cause a patient to need to return quickly for further care, it may be possible to identify areas of treatment to be improved, or isolate warning signs and give additional preventative care to an at-risk patient. While the medical community has not yet found a comprehensive cure for diabetes, there are many methods of treatment, medicine, and lifestyle that are helpful towards minimizing the effects of the disease in everyday life and reducing harm should a serious incident occur.  

 First, removal of insignificant variables based on exploratory data analysis was done, including a group of 24 variables concerning the specific medicine given during the stay. After combining some of the remaining variables into four new variables via a technique called principal component analysis, Python was used  in an effort to fit a logistic model, a decision tree model, and a neural network model. It was found that the variables in the dataset could not greatly enable us in distinguishing readmittance, further scope towards outlining readmittance can be identifying majority existing diagnosis of diabetic patients such as circulatory, endocrine etc and gathering more generic health parameters relating to that specific diagnosis, these parameters can potentially help distinguish the granularity of time in the readmittance.
